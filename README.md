​
## How it Works
​
This application begins with the user using the npm command to kickoff the application. From here the user will need to open localhost:3000 in the browser.
​
When the application opens the user will see the user directory application.

​
The application gives the user the opportunity to view all employees, with sorting and filtering options.
​
To view employees sorted by age in ascending order, the user can click on the Age checkbox.

​

​
The user can also view employees filtered by their name. As the user types letters into the search box, the employees become filtered based on whether an employee's name includes that entered substring. The user can even filter by name while still sorting by age, if the Age checkbox is kept checked.
